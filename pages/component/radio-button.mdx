# Animated Radio Button

A fun radio button component with character.

Built with accessibility in mind, following the [W3C Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/tr/2017/wd-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20170628/examples/radio/radio-1/radio-1.html).

### Variations

Using the `initialActive` prop, an option can be selected from the start from the group.

<ExampleContainer>
  <SingleGroup />
</ExampleContainer>

<br />

There are three size variants available, as well as a distinct disabled status, used for the First floors in this example. Here, you can also see that when the components mount, there is no initially selected option.

<ExampleContainer>
  <DisabledSizeVariants />
</ExampleContainer>
